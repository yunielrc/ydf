## About

Are you tired of dealing with dotfiles of tools you are not using, are you tired
of installing a bunch of messy and dirty configs and executing an
elephant script.

This solution brings you a simple way to declare and install idempotently the tools
you need along with its configurations, following the principles of high cohesion
and low coupling. Turn the chaos to order, if you install the configuration, you
install the tool because those belong to the same `package`.

With this solution you can create multiple selections of packages for your different
needs, for example, you can create a `packages selection` for your laptop, desktop,
servers, different operating systems, etc.

Declaring your working environment give you some benefits: transparency and control
over it, allowing you to easily reproduce it on a new machine or fresh OS, you can
share it with others, so they can reproduce your working environment, you can version it with git.

> What you write you can read, share, save and reproduce, it is simply there, it exists.

```

⚠️ Attention: Instructions that rely on optional dependencies can't be used
   with the minimal installation. For each instruction you want to use install
   its dependency.

Instruction | Optional dependency
---------|----------
 `@snap` | snapd
 `@flatpak` | flatpak
 `docker-compose.yml` | docker, docker-compose
 `@yay` | yay
 `*.plugin.zsh` | yzsh
 `*.theme.zsh` | yzsh

## Configure

Edit the config file:

- Set the variable `YDF_PACKAGE_SERVICE_DEFAULT_OS` to `manjaro` or `ubuntu`
  according to your distro. If you have any other distro don't set this variable.

```sh
vim ~/.ydf.env
```

## YDF Package

### What is a package?

A `package` is a directory containing files and directories in which some have
a special meaning for the `interpreter`. ydf is an `interpreter`.

### What are the directories and files with special meaning?

Here is an example of a `package` with 19 directories and files with special
meaning, those are `instructions` that work on any linux distribution:

```sh
package1
├── preinstall           # Script executed before all instructions
├── @flatpak             # Install <package1> with flatpak
├── @snap                # Install <package1> with snap
├── install              # Script executed on install
├── docker-compose.yml   # Run docker compose up -d
├── package1.plugin.zsh  # Install yzsh plugin
├── package1.theme.zsh   # Install yzsh theme
├── homeln/              # Create symlinks on home for the first level files and
|                        # directories inside this directory
├── homelnr/             # Create symlinks on home for all files inside this
|                        # directory
├── homecp/              # Copy all files to home directory
├── rootcp/              # Copy all files to root directory
├── homecat/             # Concatenate all files with those existing in home
├── rootcat/             # Concatenate all files with those existing in root
├── homecps/             # Evaluate variables in files and copy them to home
├── rootcps/             # Evaluate variables in files and copy them to root
├── homecats/            # Evaluate variables in files and concatenates them with
|                        # those existing in home
├── rootcats/            # Evaluate variables in files and concatenates them with
|                        # those existing in root
├── dconf.ini            # Load gnome dconf settings
└── postinstall          # Script executed after all instructions
```

The `instructions` can be grouped in 4 categories:

- Scripts instructions: `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`.
These instructions are shell scripts that are executed by bash.

- Package manager instructions: `@flatpak`, `@snap`.
These instrucions are plain text files, the file can have inside one or more package
names that are going to be installed. The file can be empty, in this case the package
`package1` is going to be installed.

- Directory instructions: `homeln`, `homelnr`, `homecp`, `rootcp`, `homecat`,
`rootcat`, `homecps`, `rootcps`, `homecats`, `rootcats`.
These instructions are directories that contains files that are going to be
symlinked, copied or concatenated to the home or root directory. For those
that end with `s` all the variables inside each file are substituted with the
values defined in the `envsubst.env` file that is inside the `packages directory`.

- Tool files instructions: `docker-compose.yml`, `dconf.ini`, `package1.plugin.zsh`,
`package1.theme.zsh`.
These instructions are files that are going to be used by a tool. For example
`docker-compose.yml` is going to be used by docker compose.
The `package1.plugin.zsh` is a plugin that is going to be installed inside the
YZSH data directory and used by YZSH.

These `instructions` only work for archlinux, manjaro linux an others arch distros:

```sh
package2
├── @pacman
└── @yay
```

These `instructions` only work for debian, ubuntu and others debian distros:

```sh
package3
├── @apt
└── @apt-get
```

create a pull request.

### What is a YDF Packages Directory

The `packages directory` is the declaration of your working environment. It's a
directory that contains a list of `packages` and the `envsubst.env` file, besides
it can have one or more `packages selection` files.

Below is shown the recommended approach of a `packages directory`:

```sh
~/.ydf-packages       # packages directory
├── bat/              # package
├── bmon/             # package
├── htop/             # package
├── aws-cli-v2/       # package
├── mpv/              # package
├── ....              # package
├── envsubst.env      # substitution variables
├── pc-gaming.pkgs    # packages selection
├── laptop-work.pkgs  # packages selection
└── ....              # packages selection
```

The `envsubst.env` file has the variables that are evaluated in the files inside
of `Directory instructions` that end with `s`.

The `packages selection` are plain text files that contains a list of `packages`
one per line.

The `packages directory` is where the `interpreter` is going to look for
`packages`, `substitution variables` and `packages selection`.

👉 You can check out my `packages directory` at: <https://github.com/yunielrc/.ydf-packages>

Below is shown the approach of only one big `package` with all dotfiles inside,
this is the classic approach used by the most well-known dotfiles managers:

```sh
~/.ydf-packages/all/homelnr
├── .vedv.env
├── .viminfo
├── .vultr-cli.yaml
├── .xinitrc
├── .ydf.env
├── .yzsh
│   ├── aliases.zsh
│   ├── environment.zsh
│   └── .yzsh.env
├── .zsh_plugins.zsh
├── .zshrc
└── ....
```

The advantages of this approach are:

1. simplicity
2. ease of creation

The disadvantages of this approach are:

1. you can't make a custom pick of packages to install
2. loss of the relationship between tool installation and configuration
3. it breaks the principle of high cohesion and low coupling
4. no suitable for sharing, because #1
5. no `packages selection`
6. no `substitution variables`
7. no instructions other than `homelnr`

## Usage

Reload your shell to load the new PATH.

```sh
exec $SHELL
```

Show the help

```sh
ydf --help
```

```sh
# command output:
${YDF_HELP}
```

### Add packages to your packages directory

Before adding a `package` to your `packages directory` you must create a git
repository.

```sh
cd ~/.ydf-packages
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_user>/.ydf-packages.git
```

Open the `packages directory` in your favorite code editor .

```sh
code ~/.ydf-packages
```

Create a `package` and add `instructions` to it. You can check out my `packages directory`
at: <https://github.com/yunielrc/.ydf-packages>

Add variables to the `~/.ydf-packages/envsubst.env` if apply.

Test that the `package` works.

```sh
ydf package install <package>
```

Verify that the software was installed and configured correctly.

Create a `packages selection` if apply and add the package.

```sh
echo "<package>" >> ~/.ydf-packages/<packages_selection>.pkgs
```

Commit the changes.

```sh
cd ~/.ydf-packages
git add .
git commit -m "Add <package>"
git push -u origin master
```

### Install packages

When you reinstall your OS or on a new machine you can:

Install packages from a `packages selection` file

```sh
ydf package install <packages_selection>.pkgs
```

Install some packages

```sh
ydf package install <package1> <package2> ...
```

Install one package

```sh
ydf package install <package>
```

👉 You can test the installation of the packages on a virtual machine before
   install them on a real one.

It's recommended to check out `vedv` at <https://github.com/yunielrc/vedv>
for working with virtual machines.
